      <description>&lt;p&gt;We think your online privacy is very important and weâ€™ll do our best to protect it. This web page describes the type of personal information we collect from you and what we do with it. We hope you find it useful in deciding whether or not to share information about yourself with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we would like to stress that we follow the privacy requirements provided by Facebook for all applications that wish to participate in the Facebook ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information We Used&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you authorize app to access your Facebook account, we collect and store some information about you, such as your Facebook identifier which we use to save your photo frame or collage or image to your  photo album. The full list of information we collect is presented to you on the Facebook authorization screen.
Policy Changes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we continually try to add useful new features to the app, we might start collecting information beyond what has been described in this policy. In this case, we will update this policy promptly so you know what has been changed. Please do check back frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More Information&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do our best to protect your privacy and to keep our privacy policy easy to understand. If you have further questions regarding your privacy, please contact us at: livecollage.us@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;
